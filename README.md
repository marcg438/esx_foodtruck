# ESX Food Truck Updates

## Overview
This repository has been updated to improve compatibility and correct several localization issues in the ESX Food Truck script.

## Changes Made

### 1. SQL Files Update
- **Standardized Item Column Names**: The SQL files have been modified to ensure consistency in item column names across the database.

### 2. Localization Fixes
- **French Locales**: Corrected naming and key issues in French locales to ensure that menu titles are displayed correctly.

### 3. ESX Event Calls
- **Updated Method of Calling ESX**: Replaced deprecated ESX event calls with the new exports method (`exports['es_extended']:getSharedObject()`) to enhance compatibility with the current ESX framework.

## THIS IS A WIP

Needs esx_jobs for the packaged_chicken item.
